You are enhancing the existing Care-Assistant-AI web application with a fully INBUILT automatic language translation system using voice recognition. The application must behave in a user-friendly way. Requirement: whenever any person opens the app on mobile or desktop, the HOME PAGE should be displayed instantly in English text and English audio as DEFAULT. The app must NOT ask the user to speak or show any voice popup. The interface should load normally like a regular web app first.

After the home page is loaded, within the first 5 seconds, the system should quietly enable microphone access in the background, listen to the user’s natural speech, and automatically detect the user’s native language from their voice without any manual interaction. During this period show only a small message on screen: “Detecting your native language in background…”. Exactly at or before 5 seconds, recognize the spoken language (for example Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, English, or any worldwide language).

Once detected, immediately switch the entire application automatically: convert all visible UI text, labels, buttons, messages, AI chat responses, and AI audio outputs into that detected language. Implement continuous monitoring for simple voice commands so that anytime the user can override by saying the language name they WANT TO READ (like “English”, “Telugu”, “Hindi” etc.). Even if the user speaks a language like Hindi but cannot read Hindi, include logic to translate everything into their preferred readable language based on their spoken command.

Use only free and reliable JavaScript/React-based technologies for speech-to-text processing, language detection, and translation APIs. Ensure responsive UI design, accessibility, noise filtering, permission handling, fallback to English if detection fails, smooth transitions, and cross-platform compatibility across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Chrome, Edge, Safari browsers. The solution must be automatic, seamless, and require ZERO manual language selection from the user.
